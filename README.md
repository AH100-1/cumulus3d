# cumulus3d

**cumulus3d** — progressive multi-view 3D reconstruction in Rust: point clouds accumulate like cumulus clouds as video frames arrive.
It is built and validated for **drone-formation aerial video**: three cameras flying in formation (about 30 m altitude, oblique downward views) with GPS.
All default parameters were tuned and measured on this setting; other kinds of video are not validated yet and may need re-tuning.

A Rust workspace that builds 3D point clouds from drone-formation video **progressively**.
While video arrives position by position, it chains feature extraction → matching → SfM → GPS alignment → densification inside a single process,
produces a fast preview (no BA) and a refined result (with BA) for every zone, and stacks per-step snapshots on the refined map (ENU).
Stages hand data to each other through in-memory data structures, with no intermediate database or on-disk model folders.

API doc comments are currently in Korean; English translation is planned.

| `crates/matching` (`cumulus3d-matching`) | Descriptor matching, pair lists, two-view geometry (E/F/H) estimation and verification |
| `crates/ba` (`cumulus3d-ba`) | Bundle adjustment (trust-region LM, Schur-complement linear solver), absolute pose refinement |
| `crates/sfm` (`cumulus3d-sfm`) | Global SfM (rotation averaging + position estimation), image registration, triangulation |

The full public API map (which function to use for what, and how the crates depend on each other) is in [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).
Each crate's public items are listed in `crates/*/README.md`; executable usage is in `crates/cli/README.md`.

target/release/cumulus3d model_analyzer --path <model folder>
```

## Event-driven architecture

The pipeline is split into four layers: **state value + reducer + event + hook**. Internal computation is owned by the state object,
and the outside world only sees a functional endpoint: "feed an input, get a new state and events back".

```
new frame set ──▶ step(&Session, FrameSet) ──▶ (new Session, Vec<Event>)
                                                  │
    Pipeline (queues · policies · panic isolation)┤
          ┌──────────────┬──────────────┬─────────┴────┬──────────────┐
   on(FrameRegistered) on_zone_preview on_zone_refined   on_any        subscribe()
    (closure hook)     (closure hook)  (closure hook)  (default sinks) (channel receiver)
```

### 1. State and reducer (`session`)

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `step(&Session, FrameSet) -> (Session, Vec<Event>)` | Processes the frame set of one position: feature extraction → pair matching → registration and triangulation → preview densification when a zone closes; refinement starts in the background |
| `poll(&Session)` | Collects finished background refinement results as events (non-blocking) |
| `command(&Session, Command)` | `ResetFrom(position)`: rewind to the state just before that position; `InvalidateZone(k)`: rebuild zone k |
| `finish(&Session)` | Closes the remaining zones, waits for all background work, and collects the results |

- `Session` is a value. Models and the feature store are shared via `Arc` and copied only on change, so passing state around is cheap.
- The same input yields the same events (with a fixed seed). Every event carries a monotonically increasing session version.

### 2. Events (`events`)

Each frame set you feed produces results split by stage, as events. Point clouds carry only the changed zone pieces, not the whole cloud every time.

| When | Events |
|---|---|
| Start | `Started` |
| Per position | `FrameIngested` → `FeaturesExtracted` (per image) → `PairsMatched` → `ModelInitialized` (for the first model) → `FrameRegistered` (per image) → `PositionDone` |
| When a zone closes | `ZoneArrived` → `ZonePreview` (preview point cloud, no BA) |
| Background refinement | `RefineStarted` → `ZoneAdjusted` → `ZoneRefinedPose` (pose statistics after BA and GPS alignment) → `ZoneRefined` (refined point cloud, replaces the preview of the same zone) |
| Refined result adopted | `BaseAdopted` (registration continues on top of the refined model from then on) |
| Coordinate frame update | `Reanchored` (only the Sim3 transform of zones already sent), `Snapshot` |
| Command results | `Reset`, `ZoneInvalidated` |
| End | `AllPositionsDone` → `AllRefinedDone` → `Finished` (per-stage timings and final model statistics) |
| Other | `Log`, `Warning`, `Error` |

An edge client can keep its view up to date by handling just three cases: "add (`ZonePreview`) · replace (`ZoneRefined`) · transform (`Reanchored`)".

### 3. Pipeline and hooks (`pipeline`)

- `Pipeline::new(reducer)` wraps a reducer and provides `push(input)` / `poll()` / `command(c)` / `finish()`.
- Hooks: `.on(EventKind, |e| …)`, `.on_any(…)`, and the convenience methods `.on_zone_preview`, `.on_zone_refined`, `.on_snapshot`,
  `.on_position_done`, `.on_message`. To receive events over a channel, use `.subscribe() -> Receiver<Event>`.
- Execution: asynchronous by default (a worker-thread queue per kind, order preserved within a kind), so slow hooks never block computation. With `.sync(true)` hooks run immediately on the same thread.
- Queue policy `.policy(kind, …)`: `KeepAll` (default), `LatestPerKey` (drops older unprocessed events for the same zone — for refreshing a preview display), `LatestOnly`.
- If a hook panics, the pipeline keeps running and an `Error` event is sent to subscriber channels.
- `finish()` returns `(reducer, Summary)` (event count, counts per kind, hook calls and panics, events dropped by policy).
- Reducers are abstracted by the `pipeline::Reducer` trait, so the same driver can run other state machines instead of `Session`.

### 4. Default output hooks (`sinks`)

A single call, `sinks::attach(pipeline, out, &SinkOptions)`, attaches a set of hooks that produce the same files as `cumulus3d stream`.

| Hook | Output |
|---|---|
| `TimelineSink` | `timeline.txt` (event time + message) |
| `RunLogSink` | `run.log`, `DONE` |
| `ZonePlySink` | `full/{preview,refined}/*.ply` |
| `ModelSink` (`save_models`) | `work/models/…` |
| `SnapshotSink` | `aligned/`, `snapshots/event_NN_*.ply`, `snapshots/manifest.json`, `final_frame/` |

`cumulus3d stream` itself runs on this architecture: it assembles a session plus the default output hooks, calls `push` for every position, then calls `finish`.

### Library: pipeline + closure hooks

Every time you feed the frame set of one position, the session emits per-stage events (`ZoneArrived`, `ZonePreview`, `ZoneRefined`, …),
and the hooks you registered receive them. `sinks::attach` attaches the default hooks that produce the same files as `cumulus3d stream`
(timeline.txt, run.log, full/, aligned/, snapshots/, manifest.json, final_frame/).

```rust
use cumulus3d_cli::events::{Event, EventKind};
use cumulus3d_cli::pipeline::Pipeline;
use cumulus3d_cli::session::{FrameSet, Input, Session, SessionConfig};
use cumulus3d_cli::sinks::{self, SinkOptions};

let mut cfg = SessionConfig::new("data/images");
cfg.gps = cumulus3d_core::io::read_gps_file("data/gps_ref.txt")?;
cfg.total_positions = Some(80);

let p = Pipeline::new(Session::new(cfg))
    .on_zone_preview(|zone, cloud| println!("preview {}: {} points", zone.zone, cloud.len()))
    .on_zone_refined(|zone, cloud| println!("refined {}: {} points", zone.zone, cloud.len()))
    .on(EventKind::PositionDone, |e: &Event| println!("{}", e.timeline_text().unwrap()));
let mut p = sinks::attach(p, "out".as_ref(), &SinkOptions { echo: false, save_models: false })?;

for pos in 0..80 {
    let frames = ["camF", "camR", "camL"].map(|c| (c, format!("{c}/{c}_{:04}.jpg", pos * 3)));
    p.push(Input::Frames(FrameSet::new(frames)));
}
let (_session, summary) = p.finish(); // waits for remaining refinement and drains the hook queues
```

To run it right away on a synthetic scene: `cargo run --release -p cumulus3d-cli --example hooks -- <output folder>`.
