//! Declarative incremental composition for live frame sources.
//!
//! [`crate::declare::Recon`] runs a finite, pre-discovered folder to completion. This module is the live counterpart:
//! a retained node ([`ReconNode`]) owns a [`Session`] and its [`Pipeline`], and the caller only *declares* the current
//! input state ([`FrameState`]). The node reconciles each declaration against what it has already accepted and does
//! the minimal incremental work:
//!
//! | declared state | node action |
//! |---|---|
//! | new synchronized set (next sequence) | ingest one position |
//! | same key and revision again | nothing ([`Outcome::Duplicate`]) |
//! | set with cameras missing, or [`FrameState::Pending`] | wait, ingest nothing ([`Outcome::Waiting`]) |
//! | sequence jump (dropped frames) | ingest, report the gap ([`Outcome::Appended`]`{ skipped }`) |
//! | late arrival of an older sequence | per [`ReconcilePolicy`] |
//! | higher revision of an accepted sequence | per [`ReconcilePolicy`] |
//! | [`FrameState::End`] / [`ReconNode::close`] | close open zones, drain refinement, final events |
//!
//! Frames are identified by [`FrameKey`] (`source_id`, `sequence`, `revision`), not by path. Each accepted sequence
//! becomes one position, in sequence order. Payloads can be files under the image folder or in-memory images
//! ([`FramePayload`]); in-memory images are written atomically to a spool folder inside the image folder, because the
//! reconstruction core reads images by name.
//!
//! Events are the ordinary pipeline events (hooks registered on the builder, or [`ReconNode::subscribe`]).
//! Reconciliation decisions that drop or reorder input are also reported as [`Event::Warning`].
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cumulus3d_cli::compose::{reconstruct, CompositionHost, FrameKey, FrameState, LiveFrameSet, ReconNode, ReconcilePolicy};
//! use cumulus3d_cli::declare::Dense;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), cumulus3d_cli::compose::ComposeError> {
//!     let host = CompositionHost::new();
//!     let recon = ReconNode::declare()
//!         .images("live/images")
//!         .cameras(["camF", "camR", "camL"])
//!         .zones(12, 2)
//!         .dense(Dense::profile("fast").fusion_min_views(3))
//!         .reconcile(ReconcilePolicy::ReplayWindow { positions: 4 })
//!         .on_zone_preview(|range, cloud| println!("preview {}: {} points", range.zone, cloud.len()))
//!         .build(&host)?;
//!
//!     let set = |seq: u64| {
//!         LiveFrameSet::new(FrameKey::new("drone-1", seq, 0))
//!             .file("camF", format!("camF/camF_{:04}.jpg", seq * 3))
//!             .file("camR", format!("camR/camR_{:04}.jpg", seq * 3))
//!             .file("camL", format!("camL/camL_{:04}.jpg", seq * 3))
//!     };
//!     recon.compose(FrameState::ready(set(0)))?;
//!     recon.compose(FrameState::ready(set(1)))?;
//!     recon.compose(FrameState::ready(set(1)))?; // no-op: same identity and revision
//!     // The same node, found by id (positional-memoization style):
//!     reconstruct(&host, "default", FrameState::ready(set(2)))?;
//!     let closed = recon.close()?;
//!     println!("{} events, {:?}", closed.summary.events, closed.stats);
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! For a producer thread (decoder, network receiver) use [`ReconNode::spawn`]: the node then runs on its own thread
//! behind a bounded queue with an explicit [`Backpressure`] policy, and the producer only calls
//! [`ComposeHandle::send`] / [`ComposeHandle::try_send`] (both usable from async code; `try_send` never blocks).
